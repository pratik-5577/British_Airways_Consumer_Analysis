# British_Airways_Consumer_Analysis
This project analyzes consumer behaviour and booking trends for British Airways using historical booking and customer data. The analysis focuses on understanding key patterns in travel demand, booking lead times, customer preferences, and purchasing behavior through structured data cleaning and exploratory analysis in Python. By examining temporal trends, route-level characteristics, and customer decision drivers, the notebook surfaces actionable insights relevant to airline revenue management, demand forecasting, and customer experience strategy. The project is implemented end-to-end in a Jupyter Notebook, with a cleaned and export-safe version provided to ensure reliable rendering and reproducibility.
